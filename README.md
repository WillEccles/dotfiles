# Dotfiles

These are just all my dotfiles, used with GNU Stow. The target for all Stow commands should be `~` for installing.

## Packages

- `base`: Contains basic things that all installations should have, such as my path info.
- `bash`: Contains bash-related things.
- `config`: Contains basic config stuff.
- `fonts`: Contains font stuff.
- `kitty`: Contains anything related to kitty.
- `osx`: Contains macOS-specific stuff.
- `tmux`: Contains tmux things (I don't use it but it's there anyway).
- `vim`: Contains anything related to vim.
- `zsh`: Contains things related to zsh.
